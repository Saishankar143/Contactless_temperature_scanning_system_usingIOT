MINOR PROJECT
IoT-Based Contactless Body Temperature Scanning System
This project aims to develop an IoT-based contactless body temperature scanning system that can record the attendance of students and staff, measure their temperature, and alert if they have an abnormal temperature via a buzzer and LED system. The system uploads data to the Blynk app for easy access and management.

Getting Started
To get started with this project, you will need the following components:

NodeMCU Board
Contactless Temperature Sensor
EM18 Reader Module
Liquid Crystal Display (LCD)
Buzzer
LED
You will also need the following software:

Arduino IDE
Blynk IoT App
Installation and Setup
Connect the components to the NodeMCU board according to the schematic diagram provided in the project.
Download and install the Arduino IDE software tool.
Open the Arduino IDE and create a new sketch.
Copy and paste the code from the project's source code files into the sketch.
Connect the NodeMCU board to your computer and upload the sketch to the board.
Download and install the Blynk IoT app on your smartphone.
Open the Blynk app and create a new project.
Add a display widget to the project and configure it to display the temperature data from the NodeMCU board.
Add an alert widget to the project and configure it to alert if the temperature exceeds a certain threshold.
Connect to the NodeMCU board from the Blynk app using the provided credentials.
Usage
The system is now ready for use. When a student or staff member enters the campus, they can place their RFID card near the EM18 Reader module. The system will read the card and display the student's details on the LCD. The system will also measure the student's body temperature using the contactless temperature sensor and display it on the LCD. If the temperature is abnormal, the system will alert via the buzzer and LED system. The system will also upload the data to the Blynk app for easy access and management.
